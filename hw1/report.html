<h1> CS585 HW1 </h1>
<h2> Image process</h2>
<p> In this assignment, we are asked to input an image of ourselve and manipulate it in two ways. I first create a grayscale image of myself by weighing the RGB of the original image using the formula from class: 0.3*R + 0.6*G + 0.1*B. Then I blur the grayscale image by assigning each pixel the average value of itself and its 8 neighbors. Since the image gets blurred right after the first attempt, there is no need to blur it multiple times.
<h3> Original image</h3>
<p><img src = "img.jpg" alt = "Original image" width = "640" height="426"></p>
<h3> Grayscale image</h3>
<p><img src = "greyscale.jpg" alt = "Grayscale image" width = "640" height="426"></p>
<h3> Blurred image</h3>
<p><img src = "blur.jpg" alt = "Blurred image" width = "640" height="426"></p>
</body>
